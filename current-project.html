        Cerberus is passion project, game engine which is currently underdevelopment. this will help to expend my knowledge & skill as it allows me to experiment with 
        into low-level memory management, rendering techniques and much more...
        Cerberus is currently not a stage of presentation, but it is currently actively developed.
         Cerberus  will be presentable toward the end of the year and i hope to developed a game using it by mid to late 2027.
