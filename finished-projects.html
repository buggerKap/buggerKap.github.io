                the lab rat project was group project developed for clients inside edinburgh
                university. the point of the project was to use gameplay mechanics to get students to think about
                the ethic concerns on experimenting on animals.

                My role on this project consisted of programming the enemy AI, UI scripting, player outline shader 
                and bug fixes.
