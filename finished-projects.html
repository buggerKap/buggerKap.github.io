        <h3>LabRat</h3>
        <p>
            the lab rat project was group project developed for clients inside edinburgh
            university. the point of the project was to use gameplay mechanics to get students to think about
            the ethic concerns on experimenting on animals.

            My role on this project consisted of programming the enemy AI, UI scripting, player outline shader 
            and bug fixes.
