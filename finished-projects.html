                Lab rat was a collabration between and 6 other developers, programmers and artist. lab rat was commissioned by two scienists from edinburgh university, and was meant to 
                show their students the point of view of a rat during animal testing. the goal of lab rat was teach their student empathy and have them question the ethics aspect of animal 
                testing without directly pushing them into ethier direction.

                As one of 4 programmers, my job was to prototype and develop the enemies AI. instead of using nav meshes for the AI pathing i had decided to make a custom path follow script 
                which take in x amount of point and the AI will make their way towards. The AI using simple state tree to determine their behaviour, wheither to seek the player and spotting 
                them or continue on their route, this state behaviour only ever needs to take into account if the player has be spotted.

                After finishing the AI, I had to developed the outline shader which highlights the player silhouette if their behind a wall or if the player model is obsured in anyway.
                Each of the programmer was given a puzzle to work on, mines was the simon says puzzle.

                the last major addition which i had contributed to was the collectables UI.
